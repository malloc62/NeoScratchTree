# NeoScratchTree
An alternative to the default Scratch tree viewer. 

With an alternative user interface, a tree can be parsed more reliably for large chains with a significantly reduced risk of crashes or lag. Additionally, there is no paging, so the entire tree can be viewed without clicking through a clunky interface to see the next remixes.
